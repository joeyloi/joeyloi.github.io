            <p class="comment">My friend Atef Chaudhury and I worked with our classmates to create a profile of our graduating cohort. We designed a survey that covered a broad range of topics, including school, co-op, relationships, sex and drugs, and our futures. The result was something pretty cool- a comprehensive, quantitative account of who we had become over our five year undergrad careers. Here's a <a href="https://medium.com/@joeyloi/systems-design-engineering-2017-class-profile-8bbe8847e8c7" target="_blank" class="underline">post that summarizes some key takeaways</a>, and if you're into it, a <a href="https://joeyloi.com/SYDE2017classprofile" target="_blank" class="underline">beautiful 91 pages of great data</a>.</p>

            <p class="comment">Together with my good friend <a href="http://valentin.tsatsk.in/" target="_blank" class="underline"><span class="link">Val</span></a>, we worked on a podcast about the places near and dear to our hearts. I really enjoy listening to podcasts (99% Invisible, Revisionist History, and Longform are a few of my favourites) and have always wanted to be a journalist, so this was a fun project where I got to find and tell a great story. Listen to the episode <a href="https://soundcloud.com/onthewaypodcast/jason-sekiguchi" target="_blank" class="underline">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="comment">I feel that the best kept secret about Shopify is the diversity of the people who work here. A small team of us worked to share stories to show just how vibrant and rich the culture is. This was part of a hack days project.</p>

            <p class="comment">Coming out of high school, I was frustrated with how disconnected my education felt from the real world. My most valuable learning came from things I worked on outside of school, and so I wanted to bring real world projects into high school classrooms. I partnered with an NGO and two world issues classes to run a pilot for a project where students helped the NGO develop resources to educate youth in developing communities about health and social issues.</p>
