            <p class="subtitle">Milan Kundera</p>
            <p class="comment">"What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness?" Kundera poetically pursues this ambiguous question as he brings to surface the uncertainty, desire, and naivety that lay underneath our own decisions. For me, the question remains unanswered.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Noam Chomsky, John Schoeffel, Peter R. Mitchell</p>
            <p class="comment">Although at many times the issues at hand felt like they were being oversimplified, I can get behind the general spirit of the conversations. The commentary on social activism, which I expected to be pessimistic, was pleasantly optimistic and encouraging. I also enjoyed thinking about social issues from political and economic perspectives; something that I neither have much exposure to nor experience in.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Neil Postman</p>
            <p class="comment">This is necessary education on the subtle but unavoidably pervasive ways in which media shapes the way we think about the world. While Postman's analysis ends at television media, it is clear that the ubiquity of social feeds has exacerbated society's inability to have coherent, productive conversation. This book has challenged me to place greater effort in exercising consideration and caution in choosing the media that I consume (when/if I have choice, that is).</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Art-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141035811" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Design as Art</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Bruno Munari</p>
            <p class="comment">It is important to be reminded of the fundamental role of designers: to understand the needs of the public and to address them as they are required (simply, affordably, and without stylistic preconceptions). Munari's essays concisely demand for design which is modest and commited to function without unnecessary frills. Written more than 50 years ago, this commentary is still very relevant as design begins to take a seat at the table across many industries.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Colorless-Tsukuru-Tazaki-Years-Pilgrimage/dp/0385352107" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and his Years of Pilgrimage</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Haruki Murakami</p>
            <p class="comment">This story is crafted upon themes that we all know intimately: loneliness, regret, and identity. I certainly enjoyed the development of the protagonist, Tsukuru, and was constantly fascinated by the number of similarities I shared with him (how did Murakami know?). Compared to <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>, this is a mild flavour of Murakami, although I continued to enjoy his trademark use of mystifying dreams, classical music, and confused, tortured, relatable male leads.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Trial-Franz-Kafka/dp/1466322748" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Trial</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Franz Kafka</p>
            <p class="comment">Perplexing and stressful without relief, even after it's over. This was not a pleasurable read, although the reasons for it being uncomfortable and emotionally draining are exactly what make it a compelling novel. Kafka is masterful in dragging the reader through the mud alongside the main character, leaving us feeling as exhausted, paranoid, and hopeless as he does.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kafka-Shore-Haruki-Murakami/dp/1400079276" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Kafka on the Shore</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Haruki Murakami</p>
            <p class="comment">What a surreal and charming story; I really couldn't put this book down. Murakami paints fantastic characters who, despite being bizarre and other-worldly, I was drawn to and could empathize with. He is beautifully poetic in his descriptions of both the abstract and the ordinary, which I regard as a challenge to exercise creativity and honesty in my own observations.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Siddhartha-Hermann-Hesse/dp/0553208845" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Siddhartha</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Hermann Hesse</p>
            <p class="comment">Hesse discusses something I've been thinking a lot about, especially as I've been travelling: the necessity of succumbing to human emotion as a part of the path to wisdom. While logic and rationality offer tools to approximate the truth, these alone leave me short of feeling satisfied. What I'm beginning to understand is that unadulterated emotional experiences are necessary for a truly full life. Hesse tells this story with care.</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Moonwalking with Einstein</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Joshua Foer</p>
            <p class="comment">I really appreciate the way Foer told this story; his honesty and skepticism made it a very delightful read. In his own study to prepare himself for the USA Memory Championships, he discusses the systematic methods that are observed in experts across many disciplines. That chapter challenged me to consider my own habits and mechanisms for learning. As I reflect on the internship I just finished and the study term abroad I am looking ahead to, it was important for me to be reminded of the many ways that Iâ€™ve become complacent.</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Jane Jacobs</p>
            <p class="comment">There is certainly no bad time to pick up this book, but reading this as I was just settling in San Francisco was especially rewarding. Jacobs offered me a more nuanced way to experience the city, and challenged me to think deeply about how urban planning shapes the life of its streets and neighborhoods as I walked among them. This book is fascinating for its insights into the relationship between people and design, especially due to the ubiquitous, unavoidable nature of city design.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misbehaving-Behavioral-Economics-Richard-Thaler/dp/0393080943/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Misbehaving</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Richard Thaler</p>
            <p class="comment">While the importance of human-centered design is well understood in product design, an effort to understand people's inherently irrational behavior is lacking in service and policy design. Thaler's pursuit of understanding human behavior and then applying the learnings to create invisible experiences provides an excellent example of how thoughtful design can have consequential impact on society (especially if we are talking about things at the scale of federal government policy).</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Cathedral-Classics-Virginia-Woolf/dp/1907523588" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">To the Lighthouse</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Virginia Woolf</p>
            <p class="comment">This book came as a recommendation from a friend who lauded it for the author's impeccable understanding and observation of the characters (and people in general), as told through a stream of consciousness narration. I found this style of writing a challenge to read at first, but about a third of the way through began to appreciate the unique intimacy that it enables. The level of awareness of self and others that Woolf demonstrates serves as a distant target to strive for.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Penguin-Classics-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0140441409" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Meditations</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Marcus Aurelius</p>
            <p class="comment">Compared to Seneca's <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, I found this book to be too light in its discussion. I attribute this to its inherent sporadic nature- it's a piecewise collection of Aurelius' personal notes with usually no context or consistent theme. Seneca's medium, letter correspondances with a colleague, lends itself to a deeper conversation into very similar subjects.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hooked-how-Build-Habit-forming-Products/dp/0670069329/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1431651224&sr=1-1" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Hooked</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Nir Eyal</p>
            <p class="comment">This is a quick read that offers a framework in which product design can be mapped to the four stages that humans go through when developing habits. I appreciate the relevant examples that Eyal uses to explain concepts; it makes it much easier to recognize their application (or lack of application) in the wild. I'm going to be using the lessons here as a reference in all product design work I do.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Design of Everyday Things</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Donald Norman</p>
            <p class="comment">Although I don't spend much time working on design anymore, this book serves as a reminder of the importance of usability in all my other work. The most valuable things I learned weren't the technical aspects of design, rather the processes which come with human-centered design and how those can be applied in producing anything which is meant to be consumed by people.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Into-Thin-Air-Personal-Disaster/dp/0385494785" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Into Thin Air</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Jon Krakauer</p>
            <p class="comment">I started reading this on a 12 hour train ride, and my only regret is not starting it earlier on the trip so I could have read it from front to back in one sitting. This vivid first-person recount of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster challenged me to reconsider how hard I am pushing (and am willing to push) my mind and body day in and day out. There's something romantic about the climbers' singular obsession with summiting Everest and the ease in their willingness to sacrifice to feed this obsession.</p>
        <br>  
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/B00969GFFU" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Freedom</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Jonathan Franzen</p>
            <p class="comment">Having not read fiction since high school, I was delighted to find how pleasurable this book was. Franzen develops characters, parts of each anyone can relate to, in an intimate and all-encompassing way as they struggle through the modern American problems that we ourselves are living through. I didn't expect to get much out of this story, but it really has been thought provoking on matters of love, purpose, and, of course, freedom.</p>
        <br>  
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Triumph of the City</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Edward Glaeser</p>
            <p class="comment">After being introduced to urban design through Gary Hustwit's <i>Urbanized</i>, this book offered great insights on the social, economic, and environmental impact of cities. I really enjoyed the discussion about poverty, particularly the paradox where cities that systematically help the poor rise to the middle class also experience an increase in the population living in poverty (poor people will naturally migrate to these cities of opportunity, making it appear as though these cities' poverty issues are increasing when in fact the city is being effective in alleviating them). I've added Jane Jacobs to future reading to get a more sociological, 'street level' perspective.</p>
        <br>  
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Thinking, Fast and Slow</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Daniel Kahneman</p>
            <p class="comment">About two thirds of the way through I concluded that this is my favourite book and the one I'll recommend to just about anyone. Kahneman explains concepts incredibly well backed with tons of academic references, stories, and little exercises you can do while reading along. I find that I am now more frequently able to catch myself as I commit errors in reasoning or make biased conclusions, forcing me to slow down and be more pensive in the way I think.</p>
        <br>       
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Signal-Noise-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/159420411X" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Signal and the Noise</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Nate Silver</p>
            <p class="comment">Dissecting predictive exercises in domains ranging from economics to sports to terrorism, Silver honestly and humbly explains the reasons why making prediction is an inherently difficult task. The lessons here have made me more aware of practices and biases which distract from identifying signal from noise, and provide for a framework to make better predictions using a Bayesian method.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419280955&sr=1-1&keywords=zero+to+one" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Zero to One</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</p>
            <p class="comment">Thiel offers a glimpse of what it's like to reason about the world from a <a href="http://youtu.be/L-s_3b5fRd8?t=22m38s" target="blank_" class="underline">first principles</a> perspective. In matters of startups, technology, and building the future, it is clear to me now that this framework offers the most logical and productive way of proceeding. This book has informed how I frame problems and develop ideas and actions to solve them.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Classics-Letters-From-Stoic/dp/0140442103" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Letters from a Stoic</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Seneca</p>
            <p class="comment">I still regularly flip through and read certain passages to help me frame and subdue my anxieties. Seneca discusses a considered and deliberate way of life that demands emotional discipline. The reward of such a living is a resilience that allows one to find resolve through any of life's hardships.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419280987&sr=1-1&keywords=outliers" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Outliers</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Malcolm Gladwell</p>
            <p class="comment">Apart from its celebrated insights (re: 10,000 hours, looking beyond inherent talents and instead to circumstance as contributors to success, etc.), I found the breadth of stories and trivia to be really entertaining. This one's great to listen to as an audiobook (as I did); Gladwell is lively and captivating in the way he tells his stories.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/1599869772/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419281010&sr=1-1&keywords=the+art+of+war" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Art of War</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Sun Tzu</p>
            <p class="comment">Most fascinating to me were the discussions regarding morale and the relationships between rank. Beyond the context of military strategy, the ideas here are incredibly relevant to leadership and business management.</p>
