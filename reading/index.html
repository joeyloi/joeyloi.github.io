            <p class="subtitle">Jane Jacobs</p>
            <p class="comment">Having read Glaeser's <i>Triumph of the City</i> earlier this year, I'm looking for Jane Jacobs to provide an alternative view on urban design.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misbehaving-Behavioral-Economics-Richard-Thaler/dp/0393080943/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Misbehaving</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Richard Thaler</p>
            <p class="comment">While the importance of human-centered design is well understood in product design, an effort to understand people's inherently irrational behavior is lacking in service and policy design. Thaler's pursuit of understanding human behavior and then applying the learnings to create invisible experiences provides an excellent example of how thoughtful design can have consequential impact on society (especially if we are talking about things at the scale of federal government policy).</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Virginia Woolf</p>
            <p class="comment">This book came as a recommendation from a friend who lauded it for the author's impeccable understanding and observation of the characters (and people in general), as told through a stream of consciousness narration. I found this style of writing a challenge to read at first, but about a third of the way through began to appreciate the unique intimacy that it enables. The level of awareness of self and others that Woolf demonstrates serves as a distant target to strive for.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Penguin-Classics-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0140441409" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Meditations</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Marcus Aurelius</p>
            <p class="comment">Compared to Seneca's <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, I found this book to be too light in its discussion. I attribute this to its inherent sporadic nature- it's a piecewise collection of Aurelius' personal notes with usually no context or consistent theme. Seneca's medium, letter correspondances with a colleague, lends itself to a deeper conversation into very similar subjects.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hooked-how-Build-Habit-forming-Products/dp/0670069329/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1431651224&sr=1-1" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Hooked</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Nir Eyal</p>
            <p class="comment">This is a quick read that offers a framework in which product design can be mapped to the four stages that humans go through when developing habits. I appreciate the relevant examples that Eyal uses to explain concepts; it makes it much easier to recognize their application (or lack of application) in the wild. I'm going to be using the lessons here as a reference in all product design work I do.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Donald Norman</p>
            <p class="comment">Although I don't spend much time working on design anymore, this book serves as a reminder of the importance of usability in all my other work. The most valuable things I learned weren't the technical aspects of design, rather the processes which come with human-centered design and how those can be applied in producing anything which is meant to be consumed by people.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Jon Krakauer</p>
            <p class="comment">I started reading this on a 12 hour train ride, and my only regret is not starting it earlier on the trip so I could have read it from front to back in one sitting. This vivid first-person recount of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster challenged me to reconsider how hard I am pushing (and am willing to push) my mind and body day in and day out. There's something romantic about the climbers' singular obsession with summiting Everest and the ease in their willingness to sacrifice to feed this obsession.</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/B00969GFFU" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Freedom</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Jonathan Franzen</p>
            <p class="comment">Having not read fiction since high school, I was delighted to find how pleasurable this book was. Franzen develops characters, parts of each anyone can relate to, in an intimate and all-encompassing way as they struggle through the modern American problems that we ourselves are living through. I didn't expect to get much out of this story, but it really has been thought provoking on matters of love, purpose, and, of course, freedom.</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Triumph of the City</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Edward Glaeser</p>
            <p class="comment">After being introduced to urban design through Gary Hustwit's <i>Urbanized</i>, this book offered great insights on the social, economic, and environmental impact of cities. I really enjoyed the discussion about poverty, particularly the paradox where cities that systematically help the poor rise to the middle class also experience an increase in the population living in poverty (poor people will naturally migrate to these cities of opportunity, making it appear as though these cities' poverty issues are increasing when in fact the city is being effective in alleviating them). I've added Jane Jacobs to future reading to get a more sociological, 'street level' perspective.</p>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0385676530" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Thinking, Fast and Slow</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Daniel Kahneman</p>
            <p class="comment">About two thirds of the way through I concluded that this is my favourite book and the one I'll recommend to just about anyone. Kahneman explains concepts incredibly well backed with tons of academic references, stories, and little exercises you can do while reading along. I find that I am now more frequently able to catch myself as I commit errors in reasoning or make biased conclusions, forcing me to slow down and be more pensive in the way I think.</p>
        <br>       
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Signal-Noise-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/159420411X" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Signal and the Noise</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Nate Silver</p>
            <p class="comment">Dissecting predictive exercises in domains ranging from economics to sports to terrorism, Silver honestly and humbly explains the reasons why making prediction is an inherently difficult task. The lessons here have made me more aware of practices and biases which distract from identifying signal from noise, and provide for a framework to make better predictions using a Bayesian method.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419280955&sr=1-1&keywords=zero+to+one" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Zero to One</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</p>
            <p class="comment">Thiel offers a glimpse of what it's like to reason about the world from a <a href="http://youtu.be/L-s_3b5fRd8?t=22m38s" target="blank_" class="underline">first principles</a> perspective. In matters of startups, technology, and building the future, it is clear to me now that this framework offers the most logical and productive way of proceeding. This book has informed how I frame problems and develop ideas and actions to solve them.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Classics-Letters-From-Stoic/dp/0140442103" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Letters from a Stoic</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Seneca</p>
            <p class="comment">I still regularly flip through and read certain passages to help me frame and subdue my anxieties. Seneca discusses a considered and deliberate way of life that demands emotional discipline. The reward of such a living is a resilience that allows one to find resolve through any of life's hardships.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419280987&sr=1-1&keywords=outliers" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">Outliers</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Malcolm Gladwell</p>
            <p class="comment">Apart from its celebrated insights (re: 10,000 hours, looking beyond inherent talents and instead to circumstance as contributors to success, etc.), I found the breadth of stories and trivia to be really entertaining. This one's great to listen to as an audiobook (as I did); Gladwell is lively and captivating in the way he tells his stories.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/1599869772/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419281010&sr=1-1&keywords=the+art+of+war" target="_blank" class="title"><span class="link">The Art of War</span></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Sun Tzu</p>
            <p class="comment">Most fascinating to me were the discussions regarding morale and the relationships between rank. Beyond the context of military strategy, the ideas here are incredibly relevant to leadership and business management.</p>
